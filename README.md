# grabageCAN
a rating app for garbage disposal, created to drive civic activism and cleaner cities

This app makes it super easy to report the status of garbage disposal near you. Is the garbage can clean or overflowing?
Data collected from this app will be visible to citizens and municipalities, empowering civic engagement (through traditional channels, as well as social media). Our goal is to create a leverage for activists taking action in order to make our city clean.

We need YOU:
1. frontend programmers: android + java.
2. backend programmers: NodeJS, Angular.
4. designers, UI/UX specialists


Right now all the code is on the Android-Master Branch,
